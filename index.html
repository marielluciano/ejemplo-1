	<h1>Spring Plants That Could Save Monarch Butterflies</h1>
		<img src="images/butterflies.jpg" width="600" height="300">
		<p>The monarch population overwintering in Mexico is showing its first signs of recovery after plummeting over 90% the past decade because of pesticides, extreme weather, and habitat loss…How can gardeners help monarchs get off to a strong start in 2016?</p>

		<p>Spring is an extremely important time for monarch butterflies. The overwintering populations will soon head north to lay the first monarch eggs of the season. These butterflies need new milkweed to feed monarch caterpillars, and nectar flowers to inspire weary females to lay the groundwork (eggs) for future generations.</p>

		<p>Many butterfly gardeners prefer summer plants that are in their prime during the height of monarch season. But to ensure there is a “height” to the season, it’s important to provide the returning ‘migration generation’ the breakfast it needs for a productive season.</p>
